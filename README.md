Note review solution; based on space repetition, dynamic reading and graphing

## Concept
Using the notes in nb vault, generate daily sessions composed of 5/10 notes. After each notes is displayed, user is asked how well he understood the concept in the note. If the understanding is good, the speed of the reader increase. If not, the speed stays the same for 3 iterations and after this one asks the user to graph out the note content (objective is to link differents notes)
